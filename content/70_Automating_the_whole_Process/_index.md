### Let's automate the whole protection and detection!

---

Until now, in previous phases, we had to trust our developers to use security tools in the application development process or even the infrastructure. Now we have to enforce that. 

If the developers haven't checked or haven't resolved any vulnerability detected by the tools, it will be automatically detected in our pipeline when someone makes a push or attempts to deploy to production! 

With this, we will be able to analyze and decide if the risks brought by these issues can still be deployed to production or should be blocked and resolved.
